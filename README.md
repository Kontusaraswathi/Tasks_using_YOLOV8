# YOLOv8 Multi-Task Vision System  
_Object Detection â€¢ Instance Segmentation â€¢ Pose Estimation â€¢ Object Tracking_

This project uses **YOLOv8** to perform **detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and tracking** in a single pipeline.  
It supports real-time processing from webcam, video, or image files, and can be adapted to custom-trained models.
